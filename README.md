# C++ Code Examples

This repository contains a collection of C++ code examples that cover various programming concepts. Each example demonstrates how to solve a specific problem or implement a particular functionality using C++.

## List of Examples

1. **Max of Three Numbers**
   - This program takes three different numbers as input and finds the largest among them.

2. **Character Analysis**
   - This program takes a character as input and performs analysis based on whether it is a digit or an alphabet. If it's a digit, it checks divisibility by 2 and 5. If it's an alphabet, it identifies whether it is a vowel or consonant.

3. **Month Name**
   - This program takes the month number as input and prints the corresponding month name.

4. **Admission Eligibility**
   - This program checks the eligibility of a candidate for admission based on the marks obtained in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. It follows specific criteria to determine eligibility.

5. **Grading System**
   - This program calculates the percentage of marks obtained by a student in five subjects and assigns a grade based on the percentage.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cplusplus-code-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired code example:
   ```
   cd cplusplus-code-examples
   ```

3. Compile the C++ file:
   ```
   g++ example_name.cpp -o example_name
   ```

4. Execute the compiled program:
   ```
   ./example_name
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide inputs and view the program's output.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C++ code examples, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux-based systems or MinGW on Windows.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the existing code examples, feel free to create a pull request. Additionally, you are welcome to add new C++ code examples that might be helpful for others to learn from.
